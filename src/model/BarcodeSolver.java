/**
 * The `BarcodeSolver` class provides methods for solving barcodes based on a specified strategy.
 *
 * The barcodes are represented as a list of strings, and the solving strategy is determined by the
 * `Strategies` enum, which includes options such as `BASIC`, `ZERO_ENCRYPT`, and 'POST_PROCESSING'.
 *
 * The class contains a static method `solveAll` that takes a list of barcodes and a strategy as
 * parameters, and returns a list of solved barcodes using the specified strategy.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * ```java
 * List<String> barcodes = Arrays.asList("barcode1", "barcode2", "barcode3");
 * List<String> solvedBarcodes = BarcodeSolver.solveAll(barcodes, Strategies.BASIC);
 * ```
